This is a Billing System that 
Can host an unlimited number of accounts, and new accounts may be added at any moment.
Simple calculations, such as the computation of due amount, balance, and so on, are included.
The Customer Billing System project in C allows you to search for an account using one of two methods: the customer's name or the customer's id.
The amount that has to be paid is shown as a negative balance.
You may quit the software immediately from the main menu if you don't need it.
